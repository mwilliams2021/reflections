How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Viewing the different files helped because it allowed me to compare and contrast 	the lines of code, which assisted in finding the error.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A pro is that manually, you can see what was changed, and what was removed. Also you can commit whenever you want. A con is that you can go too long without making a commit causing room for error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because it is more logical, allowing the user to choose when to make checkpoints. Google docs doesnâ€™t have this attribute because their purpose causes for more interaction by whoever is typing on the doc.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
